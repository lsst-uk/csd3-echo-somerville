# csd3-echo-somerville
Code and VM recipes for backup from CSD3 to Echo S3, curate at STFC cloud and expose to Somerville.

Main aim to move scientifically valuable intermediate and output data from DEV activities from Cambridge [CSD3](https://docs.hpc.cam.ac.uk/hpc/) to RAL [Echo](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/898/6/062051/pdf) to free up workspace. Data will be curated and made available to users of [Somerville](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/research-computing/ecdf). This project is further documented on LSST:UK Confluence.
